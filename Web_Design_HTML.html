      <p>The purpose of the project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the
        OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
      </p>
      <p>After assembling the dataset, we use Matplotlib to plor varoius aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness,
        windspeed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualization created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of
        any trends and correlations witnessed.
